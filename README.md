Hi, I am Yaw Antwi-Adjei from Ghana. I am very passionate about data hence always looking for ways to make it easy for stakeholders to make insightful decisions about data

I am on a crusade to change the way we collect, analyze and present data in Africa in the year 2020

I shall try and train young people to become Data Scientists
